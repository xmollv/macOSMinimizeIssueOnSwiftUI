I've been working on a macOS app using pure SwiftUI, and I've found a strange behavior that I've no idea how to solve. If you have enabled the `System Preferences` > `Dock & Menu Bar` > `Minimize windows into application icon` flag, when you minimize the window it never launches again when clicking the app icon on the dock. This does not happen with an AppKit application.
